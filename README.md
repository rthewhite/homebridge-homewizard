# homebridge-homewizard
This is a work in progress project to connect the HomeWizard as a platform to Homebridge.
And therefore control all devices and sensors attached to your HomeWizard with Siri!

It's currently under activate development and in a very early Alpha stage. 
If you are interested in helping out let me know. As soon as this becomes production worthy i will update the readme 
with an install guide, an guide on how to develop etc.
